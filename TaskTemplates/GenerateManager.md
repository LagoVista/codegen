# Manager Class
Create a Manager Class for the EmailTemplateLayout

A Manager class supplies the business logic, but not the actual storage to create, read, update, delete and get summary records for an object.  Each of the manager classes will require EntityHeader objects for both the organization and user.

Methods that create and update records should validate the entity before saving it.

All methods should implement authentication.

Please review other Manager classes for how this should work.
