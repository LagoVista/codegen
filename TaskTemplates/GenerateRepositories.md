# Generate Entity Repository
Need to generate a class in the repository project that will be used to create, read, update and delete EmailTemplateColorPalette classes.  Create an interface for this class and place it with the rest of the repository interfaces in the main or core project.

This class should also include a method that returns a ListResponse for the summary records.
